ok so um
thats a explaination why every line is separate file

My idea was that all translations will be in one file

ill "cat" text from file line and then echo variable with for example fun

but with cat you cant cat exact file line

I had to use sed.

But to make sed output colorful command looks like cat ran over keyboard/BrainFuck language.

And i couldnt with command found in internet sed given line with color sooo

i had to do this with this worst way for translator, but it works.

Ill make script that will let translate easier, without editing all files manually.
