Translating tutorial

=== ALWAYS add spaces! ===

without spaces result will look like this:

Hunger:10
Fun:10
Cleanliness:10

instead of this:

Hunger:      10
Fun:         10
Cleanliness: 10

See the difference? Lower one looks more readable, thats thanks to amount of Spaces after :

Make sure in every line there is enough of them to make it look nice.

=== If you want move back to default translation ===

unpack default.zip and replace all (keep zip for later)
